# Static copy of tiliopoulou.com

This folder contains a plain static copy scaffold of https://www.tiliopoulou.com.

Files created:
- `index.html` — home page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/main.js` — small interactions
- `assets/` — place your images here

You uploaded images — thank you. Current asset file names expected by the template:
- `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`) — site logo (used in header)
- `profile.jpeg` — profile photo (used on homepage and hero)
- `home-hero.jpg` — main homepage hero background
- `office-1.jpg`, `office-4.jpg`, `office-5.jpg`, `office-6.jpg`, `office-7.jpg`, `office-8.jpg` — office photos used as page heroes

If you named files differently, either rename them to the above names or tell me the filenames and I'll wire them. To preview locally:

```bash
cd /Users/sunny/Desktop/iliopoulou/felina
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

How to view locally:

```bash
# from this folder
open index.html
# or serve with a simple HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

If you'd like, I can:
- recreate additional site pages (`viografiko`, `proseggisi`, etc.)
- copy over exact content for each route
- make the layout pixel-perfect
